The following is a list of variables in the tidy.txt output. The data is originally obtained from the UCI machine learning repository, "Human activity recognition using smartphones data set". This dataset originally provides a large feature vector of 561 measurements / characteristics of smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope data (10299 observations) for people (n=30) performing various tasks (n=6). 

This data was then processed to collect the testing and training data is collected into a single dataset. Only measurements that refer to a mean or standard deviation are kept. For each subject and activity, the mean is then calculated.

Variables have no units as the initial dataset is already normalized to [-1,1].


For a more thorough description of the specifics of each variable, see "features_info.txt" provided with the original dataset.
